APCS Final Project - 2048

Instructions

Development Log
1/4: Worked in class to write the Block class. Pretty simple so far.
1/6: Worked on the Board class. Also explored and experimented with the terminal demo
     showed in class. I'm going to try implementing it into my code tomorrow in class.
1/7: Explored Lanterna more in-depth. I also realized that I will need a third class
     for the actual game itself, which I'm naming Play.java since 2048.java is invalid.
