APCS Final Project - 2048

Development Log
1/4: Worked in class to write the Block class. Pretty simple so far.
1/6: Worked on the Board class. Also explored and experimented with the terminal demo
     showed in class. I'm going to try implementing it into my code tomorrow in class.
1/7: Explored Lanterna more in-depth and started thinking about how to use it in my
     Board class.
1/8: Started actually using Lanterna and putting terminal functions into my main function.
     I ran into some issues with commits and branches getting muddled up and realized
     I really need to think the order of my commits through and be more aware of which
     branch I'm on.
1/9: Continued working on implementing lanterna and getting the game to display in the
     terminal.
1/12:I continued working but ran into a roadblock when I couldn't commit or merge due to
     merge conflicts. It was really frustrating and I was unable to solve the issue (which
     is totally on me).
1/14:I continued to try to solve the merge conflicts and decided I had to delete my Board
     class and re-add it. It worked.
1/15:Worked at home to continue working out kinks in the project. Now that I've gotten
     the game to display (finally!!), my next step is to figure out how to program the
     actual gameplay.
1/16:Started trying to program the actual gameplay and the logic is tripping me up. I also
     realized that some methods I originally put in my Board class actually belonged to the
     Block class.
1/17:Continued working on the gameplay. It's, like, half-working I'd say? For some reason
     it's kind of wacky still, but I feel like I've got the foundation down. Over the week-
     end I'm going to continue perfecting it and hopefully implementing user-controlled
     graphics.
