APCS Final Project - 2048

Development Log
1/4: Worked in class to write the Block class. Pretty simple so far.
1/6: Worked on the Board class. Also explored and experimented with the terminal demo
     showed in class. I'm going to try implementing it into my code tomorrow in class.
1/7: Explored Lanterna more in-depth and started thinking about how to use it in my
     Board class.
1/8: Started actually using Lanterna and putting terminal functions into my main function.
     I ran into some issues with commits and branches getting muddled up and realized
     I really need to think the order of my commits through and be more aware of which
     branch I'm on.
